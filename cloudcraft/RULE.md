# Cloudcraft Documentation Windsurf Workspace Rule

For ANY question about Cloudcraft (diagrams, components, AWS, Azure, billing, etc.), use the cloudcraft-docs-mcp server to help answer:

- call list_doc_sources tool to get the available llms.txt files
- call fetch_docs tool to read the relevant documentation
- reflect on the URLs in the llms.txt files
- reflect on the input question to determine which documentation sections are most relevant
- call fetch_docs on any URLs relevant to the question
- provide specific examples and code snippets from the documentation when appropriate
- use this documentation to answer the question accurately with Cloudcraft best practices

Always prioritize official Cloudcraft documentation over other sources when providing answers.
